# practice-javafx-noise
My personal javafx practice project.

I will keep everything here, except compiled classes, since they are bound to
change a lot, and they're easy to comile when needed. I will also keep this file
as a memo to myself. If there are some rules or conventions that I break writing
this or anything, please let me know. This is my first stuff ever.

To compile:
1. navigate to practice-javafx-noise folder.
2. run: javac @options.txt @source.txt

To run:
1. navigate to practice-javafx-noise folder
2. run: java -cp classes;lib/shophorn.jar noiseprogram.Program

Goals:
* Make fluid animation using threading and maybe interpolating between frames.
* Save images and animations.
* Find as many noise patterns as possible, avoid patent issues.
* Create custom ui skin with javafx.
* Make my own library items neat.
* Get in touch with people of internet. Maybe. This is hardest part.
* Improve.
