# practice-javafx-noise
My personal javafx practice project.

I will keep everything here, except compiled classes, since they are bound to
change a lot, and they're easy to comile when needed. I will also keep this file
as a memo to myself. If there are some rules or conventions that I break writing
this or anything, please let me know. This is my first stuff ever.

To compile:\n
    navigate to practice-javafx-noise folder\n
    run: javac @options.txt @source/shophorn/\_sources.txt\n
    run: javac @options.txt @source/noiseprogram/\_sources.txt\n

To run:\n
    navigate to practice-javafx-noise folder\n
    run: java -cp classes noiseprogram.Program\n

Goals:\n
    Make fluid animation using threading and maybe interpolating between frames.\n
    Save images and animations.\n
    Find as many noise patterns as possible, avoid patent issues.\n
    Create custom ui skin with javafx.\n
    Make my own library items neat.\n
    Get in touch with people of internet. Maybe. This is hardest part.\n
    Improve.\n
